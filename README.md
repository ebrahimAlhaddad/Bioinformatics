# Bioinformatics
program parses FASTA files and store large sequences of nucleotide. 
Implements a time-efficient state machine in a 2D array to analyze amino acid production by DNA.
Incorporates dynamic pairwise alignment to analyze different FASTA files. 
Optimized code to process two 18,000 character-long sequences under five seconds.
